* Never put hardcoded data like links or api data in components file
* Put them in a sep file under folder name "utils" or "common". You can name the folder of file as you like ,  heare i am keeping file name as "constants" and "mockdata".
* It is a good practice to write all the components in uppper case;

* we can do 2 types of export -> default (single export) and named (multiple exports)
* also there are 2 types of imports -> defaulet and named (put the name in {})
    * eg import {XYX} from ../../utils
    

* in vs code you can type 'rafce' to create functional component with export

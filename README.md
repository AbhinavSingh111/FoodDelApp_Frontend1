* Put them in a sep file under folder name "utils" or "common". You can name the folder of file as you like ,  heare i am keeping file name as "constants" and "mockdata".

* we can do 2 types of export -> default (single export) and named (multiple exports)
* also there are 2 types of imports -> defaulet and named (put the name in {})

* in vs code you can type 'rafce' to create functional component with export

data.cards.groupedCard.cardGroupMap.Regular.cards[1].card.itemCards

*while mapping , the key should be in the parent jsx
